Since it is the time for the National Elections next year, the COMELEC needs to prepare a program that will be used for the elections. As its programmer, you have to design a Java class that will suffice its needs based on its identified data – a registered voter will encode the voter ID assigned (a combination of numbers and letters), voter’s name (last name and first name), age, chosen Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates. The maximum number of registered voters is 3. The application must also be capable of counting the number of vote’s casts for the candidates.

 

Below is the sample program execution:
